Chapter 13. Change Windows Manager

I made a lot of mistakes while changing the default windows manager, I completely removed all the windows cinnamon sessions and couldn't log in. Here is the how the problem begins, I removed SSH server from Linux and didn't realize that it was using cinnamon session as dependencies. The login prompt show user name and password is present but when I login, it said Cinnamon Session terminated. I was confused since it showed me the GUI to login. I had to use a different terminal, specifically the tty command prompt by using keyboard shortcut **ctrl+alt+f1** in order to login using the terminal. I remember that from one of the chapters it was talking about the different terminals that it runs in the background even though GUI doesn't work.  I had to search through logs and used command such as **apt policy cinnamon** in order to figure out that it was removed and not installed, from there I had to figure out how to connect back to the wifi from the command line since I couldn't ping outside the network. I had to research how to setup network using the terminal and nmcli application. I had to do reconfigure all my ip, gw, sm from the command line in order to connect to the internet. From there I updated my source list and started to search for a new windows manager. As I do more searching using available resources on hand, documentations online recommended by installing command **apt-cache** and used option **search xxx** for the packages I want in order to install GUI interface if needed.

I used the command apt-cache search window manager and it pulled up a long list of files associated with windows manager and looked through the list. I found some interesting ones such as **xpenguins** which add a walking penguin to the desktop. Another one I research and liked is **xmonad**, by using the command **sudo** **dpkg-reconfigure** to change to a default desktop. I used and and it took a lot of space since windows doesn't overlap but if you are just mainly using a few windows that it's manageable. I also used **Ratpoison** which is all about the keyboard and shortcut and no mouse. It is incredible hard to use and remember all the keyboard shortcut, in my opinion if I continue to use this window manager, it will take time to learn to navigate the desktop without a mouse. This become immediately no a luxury for me since I sometime rely on the mouse too much with point and click.

One of the most important lesson I learned in this part of the module is to always backup your systems to a different drive or some kind of writable media, this will allow you to restore your missing files and data back to default and prevent productivity down time.  The other thing I would like to point out is using the terminal itself, this proves that no matter how good you are with a pc until you are stuck with a terminal and no GUI to help you out. Especially you are starting a career out in the networking and system admin world whatever the OS environment you are in.
